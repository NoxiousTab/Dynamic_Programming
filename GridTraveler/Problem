Problem:

Given a grid of dimensions m x n where m represents number of rows and n represents number of columns. Find the number of ways in which
you can travel from the TOP-LEFT of the grid to the BOTTOM-RIGHT given that you start at TOP-LEFT and you can only move downwards and 
towards the right.

Example:
input: m=3, n=3
output: 6

input: m=2, n=3
output: 3
